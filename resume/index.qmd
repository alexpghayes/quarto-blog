:::
::::

- Developed statistical methods based on principal components analysis to cluster networks with missing data, to perform regression on networks, and to construct, interpret, and regularize network embeddings.
- Developed causal inference methods to estimate mediation and spillover effects in social networks, and to determine when product changes have harmful side-effects on behaviors that are difficult to measure. Used causal machine learning to improve precision of estimates while reducing computational requirements by a factor of 5000.
- Implemented research methods in user-friendly software. Released nine open source R packages to CRAN (notable: [fastRG](https://rohelab.github.io/fastRG/), [vsp](https://rohelab.github.io/vsp/), [distributions3](https://alexpghayes.github.io/distributions3/), [gdim](https://rohelab.github.io/gdim/), [aPPR](https://rohelab.github.io/aPPR/), [fastadi](https://github.com/RoheLab/fastadi)).
- Resolved computational bottlenecks in matrix completion algorithms by designing and implementing sparse matrix methods in R and C++. Scaled methods by three orders of magnitude to handle networks with millions of nodes.
- Designed an approach to find localized clusters of Twitter users via Personalized PageRank. Managed unreliable Twitter API behavior by caching data in a Neo4J database running in Docker.
- Collaborated with ROpenSci to design software development standards for statistical software. Reviewed scientific software for ROpenSci, the R Journal, and the Journal of Open Source Software.

:::
::::

- Prototyped a pipeline to automatically suggest relationships between hashtags, for a team using manual labeling. Prototype embedded a hashtag co-occurrence network and was implemented with Python, PyTorch and SQL.
- Conducted experiments on hyperbolic embeddings for knowledge graphs and determined non-viability of hyperbolic methods. Advised against additional R&D investment, potentially saving $200k+ in compute costs.
- Designed a metric, based on calibration of machine learning models, to help product teams understand reliability of prevalence estimates. Metric reported daily on multiple dashboards. Implemented with sklearn, Numpy, pandas.

**Summer 2018**
:::
::::

- Re-factored thousands of lines of R code and developed a new test suite for the [broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package (600k+ downloads/month, part of the tidyverse), improving behavioral consistency and reducing maintenance burden.
- Shipped a major new release of the package ([broom 0.5.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/07/broom-0-5-0/)). Resolved 80+ open issues and coordinated 40+ pull requests from open source contributors.
