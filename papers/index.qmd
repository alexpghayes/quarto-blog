I develop statistical methods for causal inference on social networks.

<!-- My work with [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/) has focused on fast approaches to spectral estimation via sparse linear algebra. Our primary project together has been developing a method for network co-factor analysis for settings with missing edge data, which we applied to a large network of citations between statistics papers. We have also spent some time working to understand effective regularization strategies for spectral estimators, as well as developing diagnostic tools for PCA and varimax rotation. As part of an outgrowth of Karl's [murmuration project](https://murmuration.wisc.edu/) I developed extensive infrastructure to sample and analyze the Twitter following graph (see [code](../code)), and Twitter data remains near and dear to my heart. -->

<!-- I am currently working with [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) on causal interpretations of network regression, and with [Jiwei Zhao](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/staff/zhao-jiwei/) on semi-parametric inference for experimental guardrails in a data fusion setting. -->

<!-- Previously at Facebook, I developed internal tooling to understand post content using neural hypergraph embeddings. At Facebook I also developed a diagnostic to assess the out-of-sample reliability of rolling classifiers based on differential calibration of the classifier over time. -->

<!-- research interests -->
<!-- industry research -->
<!-- academic research -->
<!-- hobbyist interests -->
<!-- applications -- cybersecurity, trust and safety on social networks, social science experiments, fraud detection, high dimensional times series, spatial causal inference, bibliometrics, matrix completion, times series of networks, causal inference on networks, regularizing network embeddings -->

<!-- On the whole, I would say these projects (and my interests!) lie at a methods/applied intersection. Theory is less my jam. I very much enjoy thinking about how methods can be used to analyze data, analyzing data including doing all the coding needed to make that happen, and developing a clear understanding of data or methods through writing. -->


<!-- things i have done: network sampling -->

<!-- - doing things for fun vs for real world impact -->
<!-- - i do statistics because i like to understand things, not because the math is fun, not because any real world impact -->

<!-- maybe combine this my job search post: -->
<!-- - deep technical problems that take years of work -->
<!-- - complex *interesting* systems to learn and engage with -->
<!-- - some sort of social good: knowledge production, tool building, methods dev, research support -->


<!-- understanding nuances for careful application of methods as opposed to theory -->

<!-- "what can we actually learn from data using this method?" and theory helps us understand related topics so we can use methods for inference by better understand the mathematical formalism -->

<!-- simple tools -->
<!-- spectral networks -->
<!-- causal applications (clever identification) -->
<!-- simple tools -->
<!-- time series of networks -->


<!-- regularizing network methods / spectral artefacts of noise in networks -->


<!-- hobbyist interests in methods and data: -->

<!-- - semiparametric causal inference -->
<!-- - rank estimation on networks -->
<!-- - ranking models -->
<!-- - spatial statistics -->
<!-- - generalized additive models -->
<!-- - graph matching / network alignment -->
<!-- - graph neural networks -->
<!-- - trajectory data -->
<!-- - effects and statistical estimability in controlled systems (i.e. repeated hopefully causal interventions) -->

<!-- application domains: -->
<!-- - exercise physiology -->
<!-- - polarization, cultural/social movements -->
<!-- - sociology of science -->
<!-- - philosophy of science -->
<!-- - social hierarchy -->
<!-- - ranking in competitive games (chess, video games, etc) -->

<!-- exposure to: data fusion, causal transportation problems, randomized linear algebra -->

<!-- less recent hobbyist interests: -->
<!-- - design of statistical software -->

<!-- not interested in: -->
<!-- - theory without methodological implications or immediate application -->
