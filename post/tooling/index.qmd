## tools i use

writing papers:

- VS Code for Latex
- store in Github repo
- lualatex + biber
- computations in R (Positron IDE, targets for build system, renv for reproducibility, sometimes RStudio for package dev)

programming/data analysis:

math:

- latex
    - latex resources i like
    - slowly developing templates for myself
    - latex-workshop extension in vs code
- pen and paper

website:

- quarto, edit in Positron

literature search:

- Zotero to save papers
- never edit a .bib file by hand, better bibtex to lock citation keys and automatically export zotero collections whenever they change
- pay for zotero sync across multiple computers

staying up to date with the literature:

- google scholar notifications for anyone who writes something interesting
- following arxiv feeds primarily with bluesky bots ()

literature review:

- <connectedpapers.com>
- <researchrabbit.com> -- import a zotero collection
- <scite> -- see how a paper is being cited, i don't think i'd ever pay for this though



notes
