  abstract = {Multilateration (MLAT) is the de facto technique to localize points of interest (POIs) in navigation and surveillance systems. Despite sensors being inherently noisy, most existing techniques i) are oblivious to noise patterns in sensor measurements; and ii) only provide point estimates of the POI. This often results in unreliable estimates with high variance, i.e., that are highly sensitive to measurement noise. To overcome this caveat, we advocate the use of Bayesian modeling. Using Bayesian statistics, we provide a comprehensive guide to handle uncertainties in MLAT, including principled choices for the likelihood function and the prior distributions. Notably, the resulting model is easy to implement and can leverage off-the-shelf Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software for inference. Besides coping with unreliable measurements, our framework can also deal with sensors whose location is not completely known, which is an asset in mobile systems. Our solution also naturally incorporates multiple measurements per reference point, a common practical situation that is usually not handled directly by other approaches. Comprehensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world data indicate that our Bayesian approach to the MLAT task provides better position estimation and uncertainty quantification when compared to the available alternatives.},

  abstract = {Statistics has made tremendous advances since the times of Fisher, Neyman, Jeffreys, and others, but the fundamental and practically relevant questions about probability and inference that puzzled our founding fathers remain unanswered. To bridge this gap, I propose to look beyond the two dominating schools of thought and ask the following three questions: what do scientists need out of statistics, do the existing frameworks meet these needs, and, if not, how to fill the void? To the first question, I contend that scientists seek to convert their data, posited statistical model, etc., into calibrated degrees of belief about quantities of interest. To the second question, I argue that any framework that returns additive beliefs, i.e., probabilities, necessarily suffers from false confidence---certain false hypotheses tend to be assigned high probability---and, therefore, risks systematic bias. This reveals the fundamental importance of non-additive beliefs in the context of statistical inference. But non-additivity alone is not enough so, to the third question, I offer a sufficient condition, called validity, for avoiding false confidence, and present a framework, based on random sets and belief functions, that provably meets this condition. Finally, I discuss characterizations of p-values and confidence intervals in terms of valid non-additive beliefs, which imply that users of these classical procedures are already following the proposed framework without knowing it.},

Milner takes us on a fascinating tour of a hidden system that touches almost every aspect of our modern life, and shows how it has created new forms of human behavior. But the potential misuse of GPS data by government and corporations raise disturbing questions about ethics and privacy. GPS satisfies the scientific urge toward precision-- but may be altering the very nature of human cognition},
