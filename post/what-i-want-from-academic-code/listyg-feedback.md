My stream of conscious for Alex:


    “as a baseline for correctness”
        I would link this text to some recent public examples of when checking code resulted in retraction
    “Researchers in particular will often value these alternative goals more than developing large, automated systems.”
        I wouldn’t say “will value”, but rather just “value”. Very nitpicky, but its a matter of fact that those things are more important to academics than practitioners
    “By differentiating between various kinds of code contributions, we may be able to better incentive narrow, purpose-specific academic software.”
        Did you mean “incentivize”?
    “Methods consumers have some problem, and that problem is solved already, and they would like the solution.”
        I wouldn’t say “problem” as much as I would say “Question”. A methods consumer has a question (hopefully with a well defined estimand) that they want answered and they need some tool to go about getting that answer for them.


I’m going through the 5 types outlined and I think an immensely helpful thing for the reader would be pointing to *good* examples of each of these. I think maybe your fastRG work? Karl and co. outline the pseudocode in the first paper, you have technical details in the package documentation. Has it been used in any substantive paper yet?


I think in the hobbyist software portion in the last sentence I would add it takes work to develop *and maintain*.


“We can then evaluate code by asking if it achieves it's stated goal, rather than some other goal that we made up ourselves.”

    Love love love this sentence, 10000% yes.


“If an academic researcher doesn't share these outputs, it actively detracts from capacity to continue the research enterprise and methods dissemination effort, and I consider the intellectual contribution incomplete.”

    Goddamn GAS, hell YEAH


“You have simply completed the research, and have done so in a way that will frustrate future researchers. It really still is good to learn some programming so that others can more easily build on your work.”

    I would even go on to say “at best, you’ve completed the research, at worst you’ve obfuscated any attempt at replicating what you’ve developed”


“I find it somewhat entertaining when a software engineering at FAANG”

    Typo, meant “software engineer”, no?


Overall thoughts, I agree with everything you say and I think there’s a clear call to action in terms of:

    People should set realistic expectations around the code they write and explicitly state what the goal is.
    People need to be more introspective around their goals for releasing research software


I 1000% think a running example would really help the audience follow along. I also think you could pull from your own work as a key example of this with stuff like fastRG.
