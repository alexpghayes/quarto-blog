  abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

  abstract = {The paper provides statistical theory and intuition for personalized PageRank (called `PPR'): a popular technique that samples a small community from a massive network.We study a setting where the entire network is expensive to obtain thoroughly or to maintain, but we can start from a seed node of interest and `crawl' the network to find other nodes through their connections. By crawling the graph in a designed way, the PPR vector can be approximated without querying the entire massive graph, making it an alternative to snowball sampling. Using the degreecorrected stochastic block model, we study whether the PPR vector can select nodes that belong to the same block as the seed node. We provide a simple and interpretable form for the PPR vector, highlighting its biases towards high degree nodes outside the target block. We examine a simple adjustment based on node degrees and establish consistency results for PPR clustering that allows for directed graphs. These results are enabled by recent technical advances showing the elementwise convergence of eigenvectors. We illustrate the method with the massive Twitter friendship graph, which we crawl by using the Twitter application programming interface. We find that the adjusted and unadjusted PPR techniques are complementary approaches, where the adjustment makes the results particularly localized around the seed node, and that the bias adjustment greatly benefits from degree regularization.},

  abstract = {One compelling use of citation networks is to characterize papers by their relationships to the surrounding literature. We propose a method to characterize papers by embedding them into two distinct ``co-factor'' spaces: one describing how papers send citations, and the other describing how papers receive citations. This approach presents several challenges. First, older documents cannot cite newer documents, and thus it is not clear that co-factors are even identifiable. We resolve this challenge by developing a co-factor model for asymmetric adjacency matrices with missing lower triangles and showing that identification is possible. We then frame estimation as a matrix completion problem and develop a specialized implementation of matrix completion because prior implementations are memory bound in our setting. Simulations show that our estimator has promising finite sample properties, and that naive approaches fail to recover latent co-factor structure. We leverage our estimator to investigate 255,780 papers published in statistics journals from 1898 to 2024, resulting in the most comprehensive topic model of the statistics literature to date. We find interpretable co-factors corresponding to many statistical subfields, including time series, variable selection, spatial methods, graphical models, GLM(M)s, causal inference, multiple testing, quantile regression, semiparametrics, dimension reduction, and several more. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {The data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data analysis. As a result, there has been a proliferation of ``data science'' training programs. Because data science has been previously defined as an intersection of already-established fields or union of emerging technologies, the following problems arise: (1) There is little agreement about what is data science; (2) Data science becomes secondary to established fields in a university setting; and (3) It is difficult to have discussions on what it means to learn about data science, to teach data science courses and to be a data scientist. To address these problems, we propose to define the field from first principles based on the activities of people who analyze data with a language and taxonomy for describing a data analysis in a manner spanning disciplines. Here, we describe the elements and principles of data analysis. This leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to evaluate data analyses based on objective characteristics, and it provides a framework to teach students how to build data analyses. We argue that the elements and principles of data analysis lay the foundational framework for a more general theory of data science.},

However, the more general case of mixed membership for directed network remains a challenge. Here, we propose an interpretable and identifiable model: directed mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (DiMMSB for short) for directed mixed membership networks. DiMMSB allows that row nodes and column nodes of the adjacency matrix can be different and these nodes may have distinct community structure in a directed network. We also develop an efficient spectral algorithm called DiSP designed based on simplex structures inherent in the left and right singular vectors of the population adjacency matrix to estimate the mixed memberships for both row nodes and column nodes in a directed network. We show that DiSP is asymptotically consistent under mild conditions by providing error bounds for the inferred membership vectors of each row node and each column node using delicate spectral analysis. We demonstrate the advantages of DiSP with applications to simulated directed mixed membership network, the directed Political blogs network and the Papers Citation network.},
