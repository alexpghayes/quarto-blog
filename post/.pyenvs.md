# Python blog posts

The intended workflow is:

- Write Python blog posts in .ipynb files (using either Jupyter Lab or VS Code)
- Each post gets it's own conda virtual environment
- The corresponding `environment.yml` file lives in the associated post folder
- By default, Quarto does not execute the notebooks, so leave them in the state you want

See <https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#notebooks> for details about rendering Jupyter notebooks.

Current plan: explicitly specify `execute: enabled: true/false` in each notebook.

You may need to set the `QUARTO_PYTHON` environmental variable to point to (base) conda environment. See <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#installation>

## Creating new conda environments

See <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>

```sh
conda create --name <my-env>
```

Using Quarto with virtual environments: <https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html>


## Saving environment information

``` sh
conda env export > environment.yml
```

## Restoring conda environment

``` sh
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

## Creating jupyter kernels

It's unclear to me exactly when I need to do this for Quarto to play nicely with ipynb. See <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53004311/how-to-add-conda-environment-to-jupyter-lab/> for numerous answers, which have sometimes worked for me and sometimes not.

To check which kernels are available, use

```sh
jupyter kernelspec list
```

If things are super funky, make sure your writing Python makes quarto python by running the following in your writing environment:

``` sh
which python
echo $QUARTO_PYTHON
```
