I am not teaching in Spring 2025.

## teaching material

If you are teaching an introductory statistics class in the "barrage of hypothesis tests" tradition, you may find my [cheatsheet on common hypothesis tests](https://github.com/alexpghayes/classic-stats-formulas) useful. I also wrote [`distributions3`](https://alexpghayes.github.io/distributions3/dev/) to be an approachable set of tools for manipulating probability distributions. The package [vignettes](https://alexpghayes.github.io/distributions3/dev/articles/) are designed to walk students though many classic hypothesis tests.

Based on my teaching in the 2018-2019 academic year I received a Statistics Department Outstanding TA award. Outside of academic settings, I used to devote a fair amount of time to teaching R workshops for the Rice DataSci club, and to helping people make their first open source contributions, primarily to the [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package.
