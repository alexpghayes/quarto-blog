:::{#hero-heading}

I am an incoming post-doctoral researcher in Economics at Stanford University, where I will work with [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://stanford.edu/~arungc/). Beginning in September 2026, I will join Oregon State University as an Assistant Professor in Statistics. 

I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). I study spectral methods for network analysis, causal inference, and causal inference on networks. You might know me from my work on [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/), a popular open-source `R` package in the `tidyverse`. 

My curriculum vitae is available [here](academic-cv.pdf). I also keep [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6g1T3WIAAAAJ) up to date.

In a hobbyist capacity, I also blog about statistics, programming, and data. Some posts I'm particularly proud of:

- [overfitting: a guided tour](./post/2020-01-06_overfitting-a-guide-tour/)
- [consistency and the linear probability model](./post/2019-08-31_consistency-and-the-linear-probability-model/)
- [fairness in repeated lotteries](./post/2024-06-09_repeated-lotteries/)

These days I'm enjoying the slow resurgence of academic Twitter on Bluesky. You can find me there at [@alexpghayes.com](https://bsky.app/profile/alexpghayes.com).
