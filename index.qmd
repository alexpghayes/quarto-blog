:::{#hero-heading}

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University in the Economics Department, where I work with [Arun Chandrasekhar](https://stanford.edu/~arungc/) on methods to make network experiments more cost efficient. After my postdoc, in September 2026, I will join Oregon State University as an Assistant Professor in Statistics. 

I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). During my PhD I studied spectral methods for network analysis, causal inference, and causal inference on networks. During my PhD I also spent some time working on [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/), a popular open-source `R` package in the `tidyverse`. 

My curriculum vitae is available [here](academic-cv.pdf). I also keep [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6g1T3WIAAAAJ) up to date. You can find me on Bluesky at [@alexpghayes.com](https://bsky.app/profile/alexpghayes.com).

## what i'm doing now

As of September 2025, I'm putting my time towards:

- Getting settled into Palo Alto
- Finishing up a project on asymptotic collinearity of peer effects in the linear-in-means model
- Figuring out how to estimate peer effects in noisy networks
- Developing guardrails to detect when hard-to-measure metrics regress in huge online experiments
- Making data collection for in person social networks cheaper and more efficient
