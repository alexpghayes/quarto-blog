I'm a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am co-advised by [Keith Levin](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~kdlevin/) and [Karl Rohe](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/). I study spectral methods for network analysis, causal inference, and causal inference on networks. I blog about statistics, programming, and data.

### I'm looking for a job!

- I am an experienced `R` package developer and open-source project maintainer. You might know me from my work on [`broom`](https://broom.tidymodels.org/), a popular open-source `R` package in the `tidyverse`.

- I enjoy writing and care a lot about explaining things clearly. I'm particularly proud of [this explanation of overfitting](./post/2020-01-06_overfitting-a-guide-tour/) and [this explanation of hypothesis testing](./post/2022-11-02-hypothesis-testing-by-example/).

- I have extensive experience with network data, causal inference, regression, embeddings and clustering.

- I excel at applied statistics, especially developing new methods to analyze complex data sets.

- I love to collaborate with social scientists and product teams on involved projects.

You can find my resume [here](./resume/). I'm currently based in Madison, WI.

<!-- - I'm particularly well-suited for roles as a statistician, research scientist, research software engineer, or data scientist. -->

<!-- I tend to focus on inference and uncertainty quantification (i.e., "how certain are we that this experiment caused a change") over prediction, but am open to both kinds of roles. For example, here's a short analysis  -->
